## Backend

As the leader of the backend development for this project, I've designed and implemented a robust backend service using Java and Spring Boot. The service is enhanced with Spring Security and MongoDB, delivering a scalable and secure Open API server. The backend provides Api for common CRUD operations for the important entities for the website and the user authentication & authorization process.

During the development, several industry-standard design patterns were employed including the implementation of the Spring Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, Global Unified Exception Handling, and Uniform Response Wrapper Result. Tools such as Maven were utilized for package management, Docker for containerization, Postman for API testing, and Swagger for API documentation.

## Frontend

Our frontend is beautifully crafted with React and Chakra UI, presenting a contemporary and user-friendly interface. Please note, as this repository is a fork, you can explore more details about the frontend development in the original repository!

## Datasets

To power our application, we've harnessed an array of data, including:

* [Yellow Taxi data from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
* [Subway Hourly Ridership from Metropolitan Transportation Authority](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Hourly-Ridership-Beginning-February-2022/ekwu-khcy)
* [Foot Traffic Data from BestTime.app](https://besttime.app/)
* [Weather Data from Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/current)
* [Weather Data from Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ny/new-york-city/KLGA)
* [Top Attractions within Manhattan](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/attractions/new-york-attractions)

In addition, we've curated two datasets from scratch. The first encompasses a comprehensive list of attractions, while the second details subway locations connecting these attractions.
